HamsterHotel

This website is a duplication of the hamster hotel website provided in class. It has all assets and elements according to the prototype, and it also has responsiveness with tablet and mobile versions.

Peer Review - Jeremy L. "Great looking website literally one for one but the packeages images where a bit taller but it did look better because it wasn't scrunched like mine. I also really loved the responsiveness. His navbar was really good I liked the logo being there and the way the hamburger looked. I also really liked  his reserve a room part."
